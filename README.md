- JetPackðŸš€
  - ViewBinding - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - LiveData With Flow - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Hilt - To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
